# How to git work done without learning it  
Essential steps to contributing work to a project on github, using common language (git language in italics). 

assumptions  
* You need to make some changes to an existing project.
* You do not want to download things, and are using this website: github.com
* You do not need to know the nuance and philosophy behind git workflow.

To complete git actions, find a button with the git wording. 
This guide follows similar steps to [this post](http://joeyklee.github.io/friendly-github-intro/guides/github-collaboration-party/), which has pictures if you're having trouble.

## 0. nerd asks you to git  

someone, probably a nerd, 
has asked you to work on a project (repository, repo) hosted on github.

## 1. make a copy  
_fork_  
make a copy (fork) of the project

## 2. start a task  
_branch_  
give a name to the task you're starting.

## 3. edit something

pick the file you need to work on and find the edit button.
go to town.

## 4. save it 
_commit_    

save what you did. 
git will require you to describe (comment) what you did. 
put something short, sweet, and clear as you can, 
but don't sweat it.

## 5. repeat  

repeat steps 3 and 4 until you think you're done.
*if you want some next level skills, the idea is that you should do super specific step 3's and 4's often with good descriptions. 
but don't let a nerd tell you how to work. 
but do own it if you end up getting lost and can't find your way home.

## 6. send it back 
_pull request_  
this will also ask you to give an overall description of the work you did.
